# RenderingFramework
This is a very simple graphics engine built from scratch with OpenGL. It provides limited functionality to load vertex, normals and texture coordinate sets from .obj files and render as lines or surfaces or light sources. Animating non-deforming surfaces and lines has been implemented.
This project is still very lacking, in the sense that you cannot download this repository and expect it to run.

TODO
* Drastically improve object loading
* Render perfect spheres through billboarding
* Make lines visible through objects with non-unitary alpha channel
* Add multithreading. Physics simulation to be run in parallel with the rendering enginge.
